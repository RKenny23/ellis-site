        <p class="lead">
          Ellis Ino Ky was born "Gia" in Port Chester, NY on February 26, 2021.
          Huskies are energetic and athletic. They are distinguished by their
          hardiness and cold-weather tolerance, in contrast to many modern
          sprint sled dogs derived from hound and pointer crossbreeds and
          purebred sprinting dogs which do not have or retain these qualities.
          Likewise, they are distinguished from laika, as they were not
          developed for the primary of hunting game and prey animals.
          <br /><br />
          Huskies typically have a thick double coat that may come in a variety
          of colors. The double coat generally protects huskies against harsh
          winters and, contrary to what most believe, they can survive in hotter
          climates. During the hotter climates, huskies tend to shed their
          undercoat regularly to cool their bodies. In addition to shedding,
          huskies control their eating habits based on the season; in cooler
          climates, they tend to eat generous amounts, causing their digestion
          to generate heat, whilst in warmer climates, they eat less. Their eyes
          are typically pale blue, although they may also be brown, green, blue,
          yellow, or heterochromic. Huskies are more prone to some degree of
          uveitis than most other breeds.
